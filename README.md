Modules  Pyautoui,clipboard needed

Hey ,Have you thought to automate in keybr multiplayer .
after cloning my repo simply do the below thing and run it using python3 as i used it and now when the mulitplayer game is going to start like when it says 3 2 then launch this in terminal window while keeping this window minimized  and check when you have to run this code as my pc is having old hardware it takes that time to start typing  so then sit back and relax it types at 2000cpm it will be more in your case as mine is old hardware.You will be simply amazed! 
It simply copies the text and types it.
THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO
open terminal and type "watch -t -n 0.0001 xdotool getmouselocation" to get the live location of your mouse or get using someother way.
now open my code and you will find click and drag now change the co -ordinates .The click and drag coordinates you give ,it uses to copy the text from the area.
now after closing and saving the code now open keybr multiplayer open a terminal and minimize it and keep aside enter the bot.py directory using cd and run python3 bot.py .Happy Typing!
